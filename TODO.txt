general
- change TGMLogging to use a shared instance and then individual projects can redirect that to wherever they want
- iPad speed test (not on main thread).
- if there are any get outs for any teammates, we have to use those first instead of playing others
- finish removing "isFinalSpot"
+ 	make touchspot not keep track of final spot as BOOL
+ 	make board not take final spots
- Plays that are 4 behind another marble are kinda bad
- Probably need a deck list
- cover build doesn't actually do codecov.

mobile game:
+ make left handed do exact mirror, not just the 2 panes
+ each player has their own discard?
+ show movement on board of other players playing
+ show predicted movement of marbles instead of just green->red (note: this is now easier with intermediate spots solved - now just draw UI)
+ allow get out moves to pick which marble in base we want to play (mark : [choose specific home pieces])
+ make card views slide around/animate/etc.
